   - This will create all tables and default admin user

4. **Test Your Website:**
   - Main site: `https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/`
   - Admin panel: `https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/admin/login.php`
   - Default admin credentials: `admin@horaastore.com` / `admin123`

### üîç **Verification Commands:**

**Local Testing:**
```powershell
# Check environment and database
php railway_check.php

# Test admin login (if XAMPP MySQL is running)
# Visit: http://localhost/WEB/admin/login.php
```

**After Railway Deployment:**
```
# Visit these URLs in browser:
https://your-domain.up.railway.app/railway_check.php
https://your-domain.up.railway.app/railway_setup.php (run once)
https://your-domain.up.railway.app/admin/login.php
```

### üéâ **FINAL ANSWER: YES, YOUR WEBSITE WILL WORK!**

**Local Environment:** ‚úÖ Working now
**Railway Deployment:** ‚úÖ Ready - just push to GitHub and deploy

The configuration supports both development and production environments seamlessly. Railway will automatically use the MySQL service you created, and the database will be initialized on first deployment.
